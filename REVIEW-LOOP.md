# Improvement loop — state

An unbounded loop: ask a state-of-the-art vision model what is wrong with the
game, act on the feedback, then ask a different one. Stop when told to.

## How a round works

1. **Capture** — `node tools/review-shots.mjs /tmp/smkk-review` (needs a dev
   server on :5173). Produces 11 screens: boot, title, fight, strike, controls
   engaged, technique ref, settings, result, desktop, high-contrast, tournament.
2. **Review** — `python3 tools/vision-review.py <model> /tmp/smkk-review
   --out reviews/<n>-<model>.json`. Each model returns exactly 5 items with
   `what` / `why` / `how`.
3. **Triage** — dedupe across reviews, discard anything already fixed or that
   the art direction deliberately rejects, and rank by player impact.
4. **Plan** — turn the survivors into milestones with a doneCommand each.
5. **Execute** — isolated worktree per item, suite green, land.
6. **Recapture and repeat with the next model.**

## Rules the loop obeys

- One model per round. Sequential — each model reviews the *result* of the last.
- A review is a hypothesis, not a verdict. A vision model can be confidently
  wrong about a screenshot. Verify a claim against the code before implementing.
- Never change a test to make a failing gate pass. If a review item conflicts
  with a test, the test is the contract and the review is wrong.
- Every landed change keeps `pnpm check`, `pnpm build` and the full e2e green.
- No AI attribution anywhere.

## Model queue

Rounds 1-3 use the frontier vision models. The full candidate list is 292
vision models on OpenRouter; this queue is the state-of-the-art shortlist
(flagship/reasoning tiers, excluding nano/mini/lite/free/batch variants),
ordered by review independence — deliberately mixing model families so
successive rounds are not five variants of the same opinion.

## Log

Rounds, newest last. Full model output is kept in `reviews/`.

### Round 1 — google/gemini-3.8-flash — `087be7a`

Five items, all real, all verified before implementing:

- `landscape-controls-fighter-overlap` — `justify-self: center` in a 1fr column
  still crossed HasanAbi's shin at 1280px. Fixed to hard corners.
- `portrait-camera-tatami-dead-space` — a tall viewport is width-starved, so
  framing both fighters pushed the camera back until a quarter of the screen was
  empty mat. **First attempt overshot** (eye 2.05 cropped the fighters at the
  knees); 1.5 plus tighter portrait margins is the measured compromise.
- `controls-persisting-behind-modals` — sticks at full contrast behind sheets
  and the result card. Now 0.18 via `:has()`.
- `typography-inconsistency-overlays` — result score got the gold treatment.
- `loading-screen-asymmetry-contrast` — status centred, bar no longer a hairline.

### Round 2 — z-ai/glm-5.3-flash — `bc53eda`

- `blackout-hides-dojo-on-boot-and-result` — **two corrections.** Easing the
  result veil alone made the detail line unreadable against a white gi; the fix
  is a blurred plate under the text column only, dojo readable elsewhere.
- `boot-progress-bar-invisible` — the 0% is *correct* (first unit is a bundle
  fetch) but reads as broken. Number now ships in the markup, not just the
  first update, so first paint carries a reading.
- `crowd-silhouettes-read-as-cutouts` — `MeshBasicMaterial` takes no light, so
  the row had to be repainted warm rather than lit.
- `webgpu-tag-in-scoreboard` — moved to a dimmed corner tab. First put it
  bottom-right, which collided with the settings gear; bottom-left.
- `portrait-fight-framing-too-loose` — vignette 0.38 → 0.28.

### Patterns worth keeping

- **Vision models overstate in the "too dark / too small" direction.** Twice now
  the honest read was "the art direction is intentional, the fix is smaller than
  you think". Round 1's first camera attempt proved it: applying the full
  suggestion cropped the fighters at the knees.
- **Two of ten items needed a second correction after the first fix.** Capture
  after every round, not just at the end — the overshoot is invisible in code.
- **A real finding is not always a code finding.** The boot bar and the WEBGPU
  slot were both correct behaviour in a bad position.
