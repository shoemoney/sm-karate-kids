# Improvement loop — state

An unbounded loop: ask a state-of-the-art vision model what is wrong with the
game, act on the feedback, then ask a different one. Stop when told to.

## How a round works

1. **Capture** — `node tools/review-shots.mjs /tmp/smkk-review` (needs a dev
   server on :5173). Produces 11 screens: boot, title, fight, strike, controls
   engaged, technique ref, settings, result, desktop, high-contrast, tournament.
2. **Review** — `python3 tools/vision-review.py <model> /tmp/smkk-review
   --out reviews/<n>-<model>.json`. Each model returns exactly 5 items with
   `what` / `why` / `how`.
3. **Triage** — dedupe across reviews, discard anything already fixed or that
   the art direction deliberately rejects, and rank by player impact.
4. **Plan** — turn the survivors into milestones with a doneCommand each.
5. **Execute** — isolated worktree per item, suite green, land.
6. **Recapture and repeat with the next model.**

## Rules the loop obeys

- One model per round. Sequential — each model reviews the *result* of the last.
- A review is a hypothesis, not a verdict. A vision model can be confidently
  wrong about a screenshot. Verify a claim against the code before implementing.
- Never change a test to make a failing gate pass. If a review item conflicts
  with a test, the test is the contract and the review is wrong.
- Every landed change keeps `pnpm check`, `pnpm build` and the full e2e green.
- No AI attribution anywhere.

## Model queue

Rounds 1-3 use the frontier vision models. The full candidate list is 292
vision models on OpenRouter; this queue is the state-of-the-art shortlist
(flagship/reasoning tiers, excluding nano/mini/lite/free/batch variants),
ordered by review independence — deliberately mixing model families so
successive rounds are not five variants of the same opinion.

## Log

Rounds, newest last. Full model output is kept in `reviews/`.

### Round 1 — google/gemini-3.8-flash — `087be7a`

Five items, all real, all verified before implementing:

- `landscape-controls-fighter-overlap` — `justify-self: center` in a 1fr column
  still crossed HasanAbi's shin at 1280px. Fixed to hard corners.
- `portrait-camera-tatami-dead-space` — a tall viewport is width-starved, so
  framing both fighters pushed the camera back until a quarter of the screen was
  empty mat. **First attempt overshot** (eye 2.05 cropped the fighters at the
  knees); 1.5 plus tighter portrait margins is the measured compromise.
- `controls-persisting-behind-modals` — sticks at full contrast behind sheets
  and the result card. Now 0.18 via `:has()`.
- `typography-inconsistency-overlays` — result score got the gold treatment.
- `loading-screen-asymmetry-contrast` — status centred, bar no longer a hairline.

### Round 2 — z-ai/glm-5.3-flash — `bc53eda`

- `blackout-hides-dojo-on-boot-and-result` — **two corrections.** Easing the
  result veil alone made the detail line unreadable against a white gi; the fix
  is a blurred plate under the text column only, dojo readable elsewhere.
- `boot-progress-bar-invisible` — the 0% is *correct* (first unit is a bundle
  fetch) but reads as broken. Number now ships in the markup, not just the
  first update, so first paint carries a reading.
- `crowd-silhouettes-read-as-cutouts` — `MeshBasicMaterial` takes no light, so
  the row had to be repainted warm rather than lit.
- `webgpu-tag-in-scoreboard` — moved to a dimmed corner tab. First put it
  bottom-right, which collided with the settings gear; bottom-left.
- `portrait-fight-framing-too-loose` — vignette 0.38 → 0.28.

### Patterns worth keeping

- **Vision models overstate in the "too dark / too small" direction.** Twice now
  the honest read was "the art direction is intentional, the fix is smaller than
  you think". Round 1's first camera attempt proved it: applying the full
  suggestion cropped the fighters at the knees.
- **Two of ten items needed a second correction after the first fix.** Capture
  after every round, not just at the end — the overshoot is invisible in code.
- **A real finding is not always a code finding.** The boot bar and the WEBGPU
  slot were both correct behaviour in a bad position.

### Round 3 — anthropic/claude-opus-5.5 — `e7762da`, `9e3bfe6`

The most productive round so far, and the only one that found a *missing feature*
rather than a misplaced one.

- `teach-sticks-in-context` — **there was no onboarding at all.** Grepped for
  `coach|tutorial|onboard|first-run` across `apps/game/src` and `index.html`:
  zero hits. The grammar lived only in the Techniques sheet, which a new player
  has no reason to open. Added `coach.ts` — one-time captions inside each stick
  ring, real touch devices only, dismissed by the first committed technique.
  Non-blocking by design: never pauses the clock, never takes focus, never traps
  a tap. Note the gate caught this one — the first draft called `readFlag`/
  `writeFlag`, which do not exist; the real API is `loadValue`/`saveValue`.
- `fix-moves-sheet-readability` — every row spelled out "stance + technique" in
  full, restating the group heading above it and squeezing names until "Crouching
  Reverse Punch" wrapped to two lines. Two lit glyph pips now; the spelled-out
  form survives as the accessible name. Every name is one line.
- `keep-faces-clear-on-cards` — **first attempt failed silently.** `margin-block-start:
  auto` went into a new rule, and a later `.result-rematch { margin-top }` maps
  to the same property and won. The button stayed across both fighters' faces
  and the screenshot was the only thing that noticed. Fixed by editing the
  existing rule rather than adding a competing one.
- `clean-hud-chrome` — the renderer badge now rides the "Show performance HUD"
  setting, which already prints the backend. Separately, the portrait header's
  second row collapsed into a floating pair: ~90px of chrome holding two
  controls, handed back to the viewport.
- `tighten-portrait-framing` — **partially rejected.** Opus asked for heads at
  ~35% and feet at ~85% of the viewport. Rounds 1 and 2 already took the camera
  in twice, and round 1's full-suggestion attempt cropped the fighters at the
  knees. The honest reading is that the remaining dead space above the fighters
  is mostly *ceiling*, not framing error. Attacking it by reclaiming the header
  strip instead is a real gain that does not risk the crop; the camera is left
  alone this round.

### Round 4 — openai/gpt-5.2 — `fc8425e`

- `sprite-grounding-shadows` — the most precise claim any model has made: "no
  contact shadow **directly under the soles**". A crop of the mat confirmed it
  and also corrected it — a shadow *did* exist, but at 0.44 alpha with a soft
  22%-radius falloff it read as a smudge behind the feet. Fixed by separating
  two things that had been drawn as one: a hard dark core under the sole, and a
  wide soft cast shadow around it. Worth noting the model was right about the
  symptom and wrong about the cause.
- `overlay-tap-targets-clarity` — settings checkboxes were a **22px** target.
  The box keeps its optical size; a 44px white square in a settings list looks
  like a bug, so the hit area is extended by pseudo-element instead.
- `prefight-hierarchy-bloat` — the round card spent the top third of a phone
  and pushed both fighters into the mat. Fixed with a scoped `data-phase`, not
  by shrinking the result headline, which is the payoff and earns its size.
- `controls-too-dim` / `loading-state-legibility` — contrast lifts on the coach
  legend, the stick labels, and the boot percent.
- **A regression from the previous round, caught by screenshot.** Round 3's
  floating MOVES and gear buttons landed across the round name. The e2e suite
  stayed green throughout — nothing asserts about visual overlap. This is now
  the second time in three rounds that only a screenshot caught a fault, and the
  second time the fault was introduced by an earlier round's own fix. **Rounds
  are not independent, and a fix's real cost shows up in the next round's
  capture.**

### Round 5 — x-ai/grok-4.20 — `b0197d6`

- `loading-progress-stuck` — **the deepest find of the loop, and I nearly
  rejected it.** Grok's screenshot said the bar "shows 0% indefinitely", and my
  first instinct was that this was a still-frame artifact of a screenshot taken
  at 600ms. Instrumenting it against the production bundle on a throttled link
  said otherwise:

      0.0s  MEASURING  "Downloading the game"
      4.0s  determinate  7%  Lacing the fighters — 1/6 pages
      4.3s  determinate 20%  Lacing the fighters — 3/6 pages
      4.5s  determinate 67%  Starting the renderer
      5.8s  determinate 100% Ready

  **The app cannot report anything for the first four seconds, because the
  module that would report it has not finished downloading.** The reporter is
  inside the thing being measured. Every resource check agreed — in dev the
  first app resource lands at 4.0s and `three_webgpu.js` at 9.1s. The card now
  opens in an honest indeterminate state and the first advance that actually
  moves the bar flips it to determinate.

  The lesson is about method, not about Grok: a still frame cannot show you the
  absence of motion, and I nearly dismissed a real bug because the evidence
  "looked like" a capture artifact. **Probe the thing; do not reason about the
  picture of the thing.**

  Also: the first attempt at the fix flipped the state on *any* `advance()`
  call, and the atlas reports 0/6 pages before it starts — so the shimmer
  became the exact dead 0% bar it replaced. Only a second measurement caught it.
- `score-timer-unreadable` — a dark stroke on the clock digits. Gold on warm
  bloom was separating by luminance alone.
- `control-labels-too-small` — coach legend up from 0.58rem to 0.66rem.
- `technique-stick-visual-feedback-weak` — the pressed knob now scales 1.09×.
  A 1px state change is not readable by a thumb that is already moving.
- `fighters-too-low-in-frame` — **rejected.** This is the third model to
  comment on vertical distribution and the second to ask for a camera change
  in the opposite direction from the first two. The frame is full; there is no
  version of this where the fighters are simultaneously larger, higher, and
  fully visible with a pad below them. Rounds 1 and 2 already took the camera in
  twice and once cropped the fighters at the knees.

**Queue hygiene:** `x-ai/grok-4-vision` is not a real model ID and returns 400.
The rest of the queue has now been validated against the live catalogue.





### Round 6 — moonshotai/kimi-k3 — `f1fd3cf`

- `crowd-cardboard-cutouts` — the **fourth** model to flag this row. Round 2's
  warmth fix helped the hue and not the depth, which is the useful shape of that
  correction: right symptom, wrong lever. Distance is sold by size, height and
  opacity, not by tint. The row is now smaller, lower, fainter and further back.
- `intro-card-duplicate-round-info` — the HUD read "Round 1/5 · Qualifier", the
  headline read "QUALIFIER", and a kicker read "ROUND 1 OF 5". Three statements
  of two facts. The kicker is gone.
- `stick-legend-microtype` — accepted, but for a reason the model did not give.
  It flagged that the legend "vanishes after first touch". That was round 3's
  design: retire on the first committed technique. But a player who has learned
  to step and has never touched the technique stick has not finished the lesson.
  The marks now retire once **both** sticks have been used, which needed an
  `onEngage` hook on `TouchInput` — the stance stick has no simulation event of
  its own, because moving is not a move.
- `loading-no-progress-feedback` — **rejected.** This is round 5's fix being
  photographed: the card is in its MEASURING state, which is an animated sweep,
  and a still frame cannot show motion. The missing percentage is the point —
  during the first four seconds the reporter has not downloaded. A number there
  would be a lie.
- `portrait-action-squeezed` — **rejected after measuring.** Pad is 228px of an
  844px screen (27.0%), each zone 179px wide. That is thumb reach. Shrinking it
  is an accessibility regression wearing a layout win.

**Two rounds, two rejections, and both rejections were the same mistake I nearly
made in round 5**: reading a still frame as a statement about behaviour. A
screenshot cannot show that something is not moving, and it cannot show that a
number is deliberately absent.

### Round 7 — qwen/qwen3.8-omni-flash — `dd37810`

The highest-value round for a single line, and a lesson about the loop itself.

- `portrait-sticks-have-no-knob-or-chevrons` — **a regression I introduced in
  round 3 and did not see for four rounds.** While the first-run coach mark is
  up, the knob and chevrons were hidden outright, so the sticks were two empty
  rings with text floating in them — on a first run, the exact moment a player
  most needs to know these are sticks, they stopped looking like sticks. The
  stick now recedes (knob 0.72, chevrons retained) instead of vanishing.
- `crowd-silhouettes-flat-gray-collide-with-fighters` — **rejected on
  measurement.** The claim was "#8a8a8a-ish light gray, intersecting the
  fighters' thighs". The row is `#4a3320` at 0.3 alpha, 8.2 units behind the
  fighting plane; it only *appears* to overlap because a billboard at that depth
  projects to the fighters' hip line. Third fix to this row. Refusing a fourth
  on a misread is the point — the loop's own failure mode is overcorrection.
- `boot-logo-black-extrusion-misregistered` — **rejected on policy, verified on
  pixels.** The model is right that the black shield reads as a misregistered
  extrusion. It is also the shipped artwork: the source PNG carries ~141k
  near-black opaque pixels, so the black is in the asset and not in my pipeline.
  AGENTS.md forbids recolouring, restyling or distorting the ShoeMoney mark.
  A correct observation about an asset we are not allowed to touch is still not
  a task.
- `loading-bar-shows-zero-progress` — **third round to photograph the MEASURING
  state as a dead bar.** Rounds 5 and 6 rejected this; the same rejection stands
  and is now on the record three times, which is the point of keeping the log.
- `portrait-fight-framing-dead-top` — fifth framing complaint.

**The loop's blind spot, named:** rounds 3 through 7 all had the same
screenshots available, and the round-3 regression sat in every one of them. A
model looking at a *new* composition notices what changed since the last round.
Nothing in the loop was looking at a *given* screen across time. The re-capture
each round is what surfaced it — not because a reviewer got better, but because
the previous round's fix put the marks in front of the sticks for the first
time and someone finally looked at that combination.

### Round 8 — bytedance-seed/seed-2.0-code — `d5336dd`

- `pre-fight-controls-unlabeled-hidden` — **a round-1 regression, found eight
  rounds later.** The rule that stands the sticks down behind a dialog was also
  matching the pre-fight round card, so during the countdown that *ends* in the
  fight the pad sat at 18% and the STANCE and TECHNIQUE labels were barely
  legible. The round card is not a dialog you dismiss to return to gameplay; it
  is the thing that hands you the controls. Dimming it is the exact opposite of
  the rule's intent. Now scoped to real sheets and the post-fight result, using
  the `data-phase` attribute round 4 added.
- `countdown-button-number-ambiguous` — "FIGHT · 3" put a bare numeral on a
  gold pill next to a scoreboard, where a bare numeral reads as a point total.
  The digit now sits in its own dark chip, with an aria-label for voice.
- `settings-toggle-state-unclear` — **rejected: the evidence cannot show it.**
  The capture has all six toggles OFF. Asserting an active/inactive problem
  from six unchecked boxes is not evidence of anything.
- `loading-progress-bar-empty` — fourth round to photograph the MEASURING
  state as an empty bar.

**Two regressions, both mine, both from "a rule that was right in one place".**
Round 1's dim-behind-modals rule and round 3's hide-the-knob-while-coaching
rule were each correct where they were written and wrong one context away. The
loop only found them because each round re-captured the whole product, and a
model looking at a composition that a *previous* round had just created is
looking at something no reviewer had seen before.

### Round 9 — deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash — `e627548`

- `loading-screen-identity` — **half right, and the right half was the best
  product finding of the round.** The card named the studio and never the
  game: a publisher card with no product name on it. Now "SM Karate Kids /
  Asmongold vs HasanAbi", as markup rather than injection, because the card has
  to be on screen before `main.ts` runs at all. The other half — "the bar reads
  as empty" — is the MEASURING state, round 5's finding.
- `control-naming-inconsistency` — accurate, and worse than it sounds. The same
  two controls carried three names: the pad says STANCE/TECHNIQUE, the
  aria-labels say "Stance stick"/"Technique stick", the sheet says
  "Techniques" — and the coach, added in round 3, said STRIKE. I introduced the
  fourth name myself.
- `in-stick-label-clutter` — accurate and a consequence of round 3: the legend
  was set dead centre in the ring, which is the hit area, which is where the
  thumb rests. Now biased to the upper half.
- `hud-top-safe-area` — **rejected on one line of CSS.** The claim is that the
  score row sits flush under the notch. `#app` carries
  `padding: env(safe-area-inset-top) …` and `#hud` is its first child, so the
  scoreboard already starts below the inset, and the viewport meta sets
  `viewport-fit=cover`, which is what makes `env()` resolve at all. This is the
  exact class of finding that looks certain in a screenshot and is settled by
  reading the cascade.
- `settings-checkbox-state` — third rejection, same reason: every toggle in the
  capture is off.

**Pattern across nine rounds.** The findings that survive verification cluster
in three kinds: a thing that does not exist (no onboarding, no product name, a
stale debug badge), a thing in the wrong place (text over faces, controls under
a thumb, a diagnostic in the clock's slot), and a rule that was right in one
context and wrong in another (dimming during a countdown, hiding a knob that
was the affordance). The findings that die are almost all reads of a still
frame — motion, depth, and state that the capture cannot show.

### Round 10 — mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1 — **0 of 5 accepted**

The first round where nothing survived verification, logged as such because a
log that implies every model finds gold is not a log.

Mistral refuses more than 8 images (`Total number of images exceeds the maximum
allowed of 8`), so the harness grew `--max-images` and keeps the
highest-value screens when over a provider's cap. It saw 8 of 11.

- `fighter-shadow-anchoring` ("cast no visible shadows") — **rejected on a
  crop.** Round 4 raised the contact shadow to 0.66 alpha with a hard core;
  the mat shows two clear dark pools under the two stances. This is the third
  model to report a defect that a previous round had already fixed, and the
  first to do it about something measured two rounds earlier.
- `rematch-button-glare` ("bloom washes out the text and edges") — **rejected
  on a crop.** The `REMATCH` glyphs are the darkest thing on the button. There
  is a warm halo around the pill, which is the art direction.
- `hud-score-legibility` — **rejected.** `.points` is `var(--text)`, near-white
  on a dark bar, and the gold clock already carries the 2px dark stroke round
  5 added for exactly this claim.
- `loading-logo-contrast` — **rejected on policy.** Same as round 7: the mark
  is proprietary, and AGENTS.md forbids recolouring, filtering or restyling it.
- `settings-toggle-visibility` — **rejected, fourth time, same reason.** Every
  toggle in the capture is off; the image cannot show a checked state.

**What an all-reject round means.** Ten rounds in, the obvious wins are gone and
the remaining reports are dominated by reads of a still frame. The loop is past
the point where a fresh model finds something new on the same eleven screens —
which is a fact about the *screens*, not about the models. The next useful move
is either a different set of screens (a real contact, a rematch, a loss
position, a first-run with the coach up) or a different question. Continuing to
re-shoot the same eleven and calling it coverage would not be.

### Rounds 11-14 — maverick, cohere, nova-2-lite, ling

- **maverick — 0 of 5, and the model repeated itself verbatim** on a second
  pass with the same images, which is worth knowing about temperature-0.4
  determinism. All five items were contrast/composition suggestions with no
  measurable referent ("improve loading screen text clarity", "enhance control
  label visibility"). Nothing to verify, nothing to reject on evidence either.
- **cohere — feature requests, not defects.** "Redesign touch controls",
  "simplify move system", "create engaging post-match experience". Two of its
  asks are already shipped: `juice.impact()` draws sparks, a shockwave ring on
  full points, hitstop, shake and a camera punch, and the post-match path has
  WAZA-ARI/BLOCKED calls, a slam-in result card, match-point slow motion and a
  distinct `CHAMPION`/`DEFEATED` headline carrying career records. A reviewer
  proposing a redesign is answering a different question from the one asked.
- **amazon/nova-premier-v1 is EOL** — 404, "reached the end of its life". The
  live vision model in that family is `nova-2-lite-v1`.
- **ling-3.0-flash-vl — 2 accepted.** The technique caption was pinned to the
  bottom of the stage, directly above the pad, which is where both thumbs rest:
  a confirmation the player cannot see while performing the thing it confirms.
  And the gear button sat flush against the right bezel after round 3 collapsed
  the header row, putting part of a 44px target off-screen.
- **nex-agi/nex-n2.5-pro could not be reviewed.** It answers HTTP 200 with a
  null `content`, twice, 762 seconds apart. That is a provider failure, not a
  review, and the harness now records it instead of crashing on it.

**Where the loop stands.** Twelve rounds, ten distinct model families, roughly
half the reported items accepted and the other half rejected against a crop, a
CSS line, or a pixel count. The accepted work clusters hard: a missing feature
(onboarding), a missing identity (the game's name on its own boot card), a
debug badge shipping to players, controls dimmed during the countdown that
starts the fight, a caption printed under the player's thumbs, and a coach mark
that had stopped the sticks looking like sticks.

**Two of those were regressions this loop introduced.** Round 1's dim-behind-
modals rule and round 3's hidden knob each looked correct in the place they
were written and were wrong one context away, and both took eight rounds and a
fresh pair of eyes to surface. Every round re-captures the whole product, which
is the only reason either was caught.

### Round 15 — gemma-4-31b-it + gpt-6-luna — `61658d2`

The round that corrected the loop, not the game.

- `settings-checkbox-state` — **rejected by me five times, and I was wrong
  every time.** The sentence was identical each round: *the capture has all six
  toggles off, so it cannot show a checked state.* That was true, and it was
  also a way of never having to look. `accent-color` tints the tick but leaves
  the box the same value whether it is on or off, so the state really did have
  to be read from a 3px mark on a near-black sheet. Five independent models saw
  it. Fixed, and then I did the check I should have done on round one: captured
  a settings screen with two toggles on. The gold plate is obvious.

  **The lesson is about the rejection, not the fix.** A rejection is supposed to
  rest on a measurement. Five identical rejections of the same finding, from
  models that had no way of knowing they were repeating each other, is not a
  measurement — it is a prior I had stopped re-examining. When a finding
  recurs, the cheap thing is to dismiss it and the expensive thing is to go and
  make the capture that settles it.
- `clear-the-stick-surfaces` / `move-the-move-list-labels-above-the-joysticks` —
  three rounds said the lesson text should not be on the stick. Accepted. Round
  9's fix had moved it to the top of the ring, which was a smaller version of the
  same wrong answer: the problem is the ring, not the position within it.
  It is one strip now, and the rings keep their knobs and chevrons.
- **A bug found by the fix, not by the review.** `#pad` is `position: static`, so
  the new absolute strip resolved against the root and rendered at y=8, behind
  the scoreboard — in the DOM, correct in every computed style, invisible in the
  screenshot. A stacking/containing-block bug is invisible to both a review and
  a type-check, and it only appeared because the change was visual.
- `show-loading-progress` — the MEASURING state again.
- `reframe-portrait-combat` — the seventh framing complaint.

### Where the loop is now

Fifteen rounds, seventeen models, **126 vision models still unasked**. The
queue was extended past the flagship shortlist into the long tail.

The yield curve has flattened to near zero on repeated screens and the accepted
work is now concentrated in a handful of surfaces. What keeps producing: a
finding that recurs across independent models, and a change that is visual
enough to have a containing-block bug nobody can see.

### Round 16 — qwen3-vl-32b, llama-4-scout, mimo-v2.5 — `c57190b`

- `title-card-font-glyph: "broken glyph in QUALIFIER"` (mimo) — **accepted, and
  the glyph was not the problem.** `.result-headline`, `.boot-title` and the
  boot subtitle all referenced `var(--font-display)`, and the custom property
  was never defined in the stylesheet. A `var()` with no definition and no
  fallback resolves to nothing, so the round name, the result headline and the
  game's own name on the boot card have all been in the browser default this
  whole time. `.result-headline` did not even declare a family — it inherited
  the body sans. What read as a malformed A was Helvetica Neue Black at weight
  900 carrying a 1.5px text-stroke, whose crossbar filled in under the outline.
  With the condensed display face applied, the artefact disappears on its own.

  **A model reporting a visual artefact is often reporting a cause.** Nobody
  in fifteen rounds had read a stylesheet looking for an undefined custom
  property; one model reported a glyph as broken and that led straight to it.

Rejected this round, with the measurement:

- `score-color-indistinguishable: player scores are the same colour` (mimo) —
  they are not. Asmongold's score is `var(--text)`, near-white; HasanAbi's is
  red. The HUD crop shows it plainly.
- `joystick-size-obstructive` / `control-sticks-occlude-view: bottom 40%` —
  measured: the pad is 228px on an 844px screen, **27.0%**. Scout's 40% is
  wrong, and 27% is thumb reach, not obstruction.
- `fight-button-too-small` / `inconsistent-button-size` — the button is
  `min-width: 12rem; min-height: 52px`, which is 192x52, comfortably past the
  44px minimum in both axes.
- `loading-progress-stuck` / `pre-boot-loading-screen-dark` — the MEASURING
  state, now on its seventh appearance in the log.
- `technique-label-overlap` (mimo) — the technique chip moved to 25% of the
  stage in round 12; the TECHNIQUE label is on the pad. They are ~380px apart.

### Round 17 — gemma-4-26b, qwen3.8-27b, gpt-5.6-luna — `011c763`

- `clipped-fight-cta` (gpt-5.6-luna) — **rejected on measurement, and the
  measurement found something better.** Claimed the pre-fight CTA clips on
  portrait. Measured at 320x568, 360x640 and 390x844: the button sits at
  298-350, 370-422 and 548-600, fully inside the viewport in every case.
  Verifying it meant shooting a viewport nobody shoots, and at 320px the
  scoreline was rendering **"ASMONG…" and "HASANA…"** — two truncated names
  landing on the same stub, so the player cannot tell the fighters apart on the
  one element that identifies them. Fixed by tightening tracking and dropping a
  step below 360px; both names now measure unclipped at all three widths.

  **A review set is a sampling of the product, and this loop only ever sampled
  one viewport.** Seventeen rounds of frontier models asked the same question
  about the same 390px screen, and the defect that survived all of them was on
  a device that is still a phone. Rejecting a claim is what surfaced it.
- `combat-hint-panel-clutter` (qwen3.8-27b) — called the coach strip a
  "permanent instruction wall". It is first-run only and retires once both
  sticks have been used. The overlap point is fair: the strip's lower edge sits
  on the upper arc of both rings. Tight rather than broken.
- `combat-callout-collision` (gpt-5.6-luna) — the technique chip at 25% of the
  stage and the referee call at 18% are 38px apart. Fair, and the cheapest fix
  is spacing rather than a redesign.
- `landscape-empty-control-layout` (gpt-5.6-luna) — the desktop corner
  plaques. A taste question, not a defect.
- `score-readability-low-contrast`, `ui-layering-occlusion` — already handled
  in rounds 5/10 and 1 respectively.

### Round 18 — gemma-3-27b, qwen3.8-35b — `8dd8bb9`

- `permanent-control-overlay` (qwen3.8-35b) — the THIRD independent model to
  report the coach strip as permanent, and the third time the answer was wrong
  in the same way. The strip clears on the first bout once both sticks have been
  used. The reason three reviewers converged on the same false conclusion is
  that the conclusion was **underdetermined, not agreed-upon**: every capture in
  this harness ran in a fresh browser context with an empty localStorage, so
  the first-run state was in every frame the loop ever showed a model. None had
  seen the other state.

  Fixed the sampling rather than the strip. `14-phone-returning` seeds the seen
  flag and captures the same bout with it retired; the review set now carries
  both states.

  **A review harness is a sampling of the product, and a sample that never
  varies a dimension cannot see anything about that dimension.**
- `techniques-menu-contrast` (qwen3.8-35b) — **accepted.** The moves-sheet
  scoring column was `--text-faint`, a deliberate ghost. But that column carries
  the scoring rule — "mid · Half point" is the entire reason a point-karate game
  has no health bars. Lifted to `--text-muted`.
- `post-fight-navigation-dead-end` / `missing-pre-fight-navigation`
  (qwen3.8-35b) — rejected: the end-of-tournament card is
  `action: 'NEW TOURNAMENT'` → `newRun()`. The product has one mode of play at
  its front door, so there is no menu to navigate back to and nothing to dead-end
  into.
- `fighter-mat-spacing` (gemma-3-27b) — the framing call, in its eighth
  iteration across four models. Standing judgement: warm and low.
- `hud-score-contrast` (gemma-3-27b) — rounds 5/10.
- `landscape-control-scaling` (qwen3.8-35b) — taste, not a defect.

### Round 19 — glm-4.6v, grok-4.7, ling-3.0-flash-vl, mimo-v2.6-flash — `fe558fe`

Catalogue refreshed from the live API first: **292 vision models, 23 asked, 271
remaining.** The local snapshot was inventing IDs — `glm-4.7v` and
`glm-4.6v-flash` do not exist; `glm-4.6v` does.

- `strikes-dont-read` (grok-4.7) and `attack-banner-idle-pose`
  (mimo-v2.6-flash) — **accepted, and this is the one that mattered.** Two
  unrelated providers, no shared lineage, the same reading of the same frames:
  "the LUNGE PUNCH chip is up while both fighters hold the exact same neutral
  guard as the idle frame", and "move-name banners display while the fighter is
  still in the untouched idle stance".

  Neither could have seen the cause, because the cause is three lines:
  `showTechnique(name) { this.technique.textContent = name; }` — the whole
  method. The referee banner beside it has carried a `bannerUntil` expiry since
  round 4. The technique chip never had one. The last move you threw stayed on
  screen for the rest of the bout, so it read as a state readout rather than a
  confirmation and the next strike was indistinguishable from a stale label.

  Confirmed by driving real CDP touch input — both zone anchors, both sticks,
  ◄ technique and ► stance together. Two earlier attempts used the wrong
  selector and `touchscreen.tap` and returned clean empty results that looked
  like "the input doesn't work"; the harness's own `thumbs.ts` dispatches raw
  CDP touch points, and a technique is two simultaneous sticks, not a tap. Chip
  now appears at 100ms and clears at 794ms.
- `scorebar-clock-reads-as-score` (mimo-v2.6-flash) — **accepted.** The clock was
  typeset exactly like the two scores, in one row, so the header parsed as
  "0 30 0". Boxed in a dial frame; the scores stay bare and flat.
- `post-fight-navigation` claims (qwen3.8-35b, prior round) — the card is
  `action: 'NEW TOURNAMENT'` → `newRun()`. No menu exists to navigate back to.
- `settings-checkbox-size`, `fight-button-number-visibility`, `techniques-icon-size`
  (glm-4.6v) — all sized deliberately in earlier rounds, with measurements.
- `controls-label-clarity` (glm-4.6v) — the weakest of the batch and the only
  one with a whiff of substance; `--text-2xs` on STANCE/TECHNIQUE is small.
  Noted, not actioned.
- `loading-bar-never-fills` (mimo) — the MEASURING state.
- `portrait-fight-frame-wasted`, `fighters-edge-proximity` — framing, in its
  ninth and tenth iteration. Standing judgement: warm and low.

### Round 20 — claude-sonnet-5.5, gpt-6-sol, seed-2-1-turbo, step-3.7-flash — `ee0b17a`

- `ippon-banner-collision` / `ippon-overlay-collision` /
  `ippon-text-obscuration` (claude-sonnet-5.5, gpt-6-sol, step-3.7-flash) —
  **accepted, three providers converging.** Stamp spans y=156–231, technique
  pill y=195–220 — the pill sat *entirely inside* the stamp. 25px of overlap,
  two competing plates over the fighters' heads at the moment the player is
  meant to read the result. Cause: `Hud.call()` wrote the move name to the
  separate technique pill instead of to the stamp. A scored point is one
  statement, so it is one element now — the move is a third line in the stamp
  and the pill is cleared.
- `hint-panel-covers-sticks` / `control-legend-overlaps-joysticks`
  (claude-sonnet-5.5, seed-2-1-turbo; qwen3.8-27b in round 17) — **accepted.**
  Strip bottom 684, ring top 634: 50px of overlap, with the UP chevron at y=650
  underneath it — the strip was covering the affordance it exists to teach.

  The rings could not move: the pad is 228px holding 170px rings, 29px of slack
  against a 59px strip, so stepping them down clips them off the pad. Tried,
  captured, reverted. The strip leaves instead, over the dojo's lower edge,
  directly above the controls it describes. Re-measured: zero overlap.

  **Rejected a plausible fix on a captured screenshot.** The step-down looked
  right in the DOM and clipped both rings in the frame. Three findings in three
  rounds said the strip covered the sticks, and the fix that satisfies the
  measurement had to be thrown away for the one that satisfies the product.
- `fighter-ground-clipping` (step-3.7-flash) — new, and not reproduced: the
  contact shadows anchor the feet above the mat edge by design.
- `teach-sticks-before-fight`, `first-bout-ends-before-learning` (gpt-6-sol) —
  the coach strip is exactly this, and it is on the pre-fight card.
- `fight-button-countdown-unclear-affordance` (seed-2-1-turbo) — no skip hint
  on the auto-start countdown. Noted.
- `loading-screen-empty-progress-bar` — the MEASURING state, in its eighth
  appearance across four providers.
- `fighter-framing-wastes-vertical-space`, `fighters-small-empty-mat` —
  framing, in its eleventh and twelfth iteration. Standing: warm and low.

### Round 21 — grok-4.6, mimo-v2.6-pro, qwen3.8-flash, fugu-max — `be7e482`

- `settings-toggles-invisible: "settings uses blank gray squares instead of
  recognizable controls"` (grok-4.6) — **accepted, and it is round 15's fix
  seen from the other side.** Round 15 made ON unmistakable and left OFF alone;
  `--surface-sunken` measures rgb(0,0,0) against this sheet, so the checkbox
  carried its whole meaning in a 3px native tick and with nothing ticked there
  was no control on screen. Rebuilt as switches — a track with a knob that has
  a visible position either way.

  **The first switch capture looked inverted and was not.** A crop offset landed
  on the row above the one I had toggled; the DOM said `checked: true`, the
  stylesheet said gold. Re-read both in a single evaluate and captured the whole
  sheet rather than trusting either — which is what exposed the real defect
  underneath, a track present in the DOM and invisible in the frame. A crop is
  an argument about which element you are looking at, and it lost.
- `stick-chevrons-low-contrast` (qwen3.8-flash) — **accepted.** `--detent-idle`
  was 0.36 alpha, about 3:1 against the ring, for the only markers that tell a
  thumb which way a stick goes. Now 0.52, a shade over 5:1, still behind the
  knob the thumb actually tracks.
- `ippon-flash-blows-out-head` (qwen3.8-flash),
  `front-kick-decoupled-foot-sprite` (fugu-max),
  `align-hit-spark-vfx-to-impact-point` (fugu-max) — VFX and sprite-atlas
  concerns raised for the first time. Not reproduced from the static set; a
  still frame cannot adjudicate whether a hit flash clips a head or a spark is
  anchored to the contact point, both of which are per-frame questions. Logged
  for a targeted capture pass.
- `movelist-combo-notation-cryptic` (qwen3.8-flash) — the glyph pairs in the
  moves sheet. Round 3 gave them a glyph + caption header; the mapping from
  glyph to the in-bout legend is still not shown.
- `controls-clipped-by-legend` (qwen3.8-flash) — the legend covered the
  sticks, and round 20 fixed exactly that.
- `empty-loading-screen`, `loading-progress-invisible`,
  `loading-bar-no-progress` — the MEASURING state, in its ninth appearance
  across six providers. The single most-reported non-defect in the loop.
- `fighters-lost-in-portrait`, `fight-framing-dead-bands`,
  `fighter-framing-wastes-vertical-space` — framing, in its thirteenth
  iteration. Standing: warm and low.

### Round 22 — gpt-5.6-terra, gemini-3.7-flash, muse-spark-1.3 — `e93f48d`

- `front-kick-decoupled-foot-sprite` (fugu-max, r21),
  `sprite-front-kick-artifact` (gemini-3.7-flash),
  `ippon-flash-blows-out-head` (qwen3.8-flash, r21) — **accepted, with a
  different cause than any reviewer named.** Four reports across three rounds,
  all describing a limb defect: a "severed foot", a leg that "passes through"
  the opponent, a "floating severed limb", a head "clipped to a featureless
  white blob".

  The atlas is clean. A burst of sixteen input combinations at five frames each,
  keeping every frame where a move was live, showed a back kick fully extended
  with the foot attached to the leg. What the burst also showed, in two frames
  of six, was a translucent second Asmongold most of a body width behind the
  first.

  That is the afterimage: three ghosts at 0.32 opacity drawn at the exact world
  spot they were dropped, so the offset is whatever the fighter covered in three
  ticks. On a walk that is nothing; on a stepping kick it is most of a body
  width, and a full silhouette that far behind its owner is a second person in
  the room. Capped to 0.1 world units, peak 0.17, opacity falling off with
  staleness. Re-burst: a tight smear on the trailing edge.

  **A reviewer describing an artefact reliably points at a frame where something
  is genuinely wrong. They cannot name it, and the name they reach for will be
  wrong — go and look at the frame.**
- `meta/muse-spark-1.3` — **unavailable.** HTTP 403: requires an 18+ age
  attestation on the OpenRouter account. Not a model defect and not a prompt
  defect; the whole muse-spark family is behind the same gate.
- `opponent-hud-score-contrast` (gemini-3.7-flash) — HasanAbi's score is
  `--fighter-1` red, and rounds 5/10 already took it to the brightest red the
  palette allows. A colour the game needs in order to read as two fighters.
- `bottom-hud-label-clipping` (gemini-3.7-flash, gpt-5.6-terra,
  qwen3.8-flash) — the STANCE/TECHNIQUE labels and the stick bottoms. Round 20
  measured the strip clear of the rings; the labels measure at y=812–824 inside
  a pad ending at 844, which is clear.
- `ippon-impact-defender-flinch` (gemini-3.7-flash) — a content request, not a
  defect: the art set has no recoil frames. Logged for the asset backlog.
- `make-score-and-countdowns-legible` (gpt-5.6-terra) — the numbered bout badge
  on the FIGHT button; deliberate, and sized to 20px in round 12.

### Round 23 — glm-5.3-flashx, qwen3.6-35b-a3b, qwen3.5-27b — `69d579e`

- `endscreen-ghost-ui-and-round-context: "ghost legend bleeds through the REMATCH
  button"` (glm-5.3-flashx) — **accepted, exactly as described.** The first-run
  coach strip outlived the bout, so the result card rendered REMATCH on top of
  it and "◄ step ▼ crouch" stayed readable through the one control the player is
  asked to press. Now retires at every point a result is shown.

  Worth recording the first attempt: `coach.dismiss()` went into `clearBoutUi`,
  which runs when the *next* bout starts — after the card the player is looking
  at has already gone up. Correct-looking, in the right function, inert.
- `add-hit-and-guard-reactions: "fighters idle straight through being struck"`
  (glm-5.3-flashx) and `hit-feedback-scale: "impact effects are too subtle"`
  (qwen3.5-27b), separately — **accepted as one finding.** The impact stack is
  not subtle: 95ms hitstop, 26 particles, a painted burst, a shockwave ring on
  a full point, shake, saturation punch, white flash, vibration. The struck
  fighter simply does not react, which is what all of that serves.

  The shove went in the **view**, not the sim. Point-karate ends the exchange
  on contact and the sim is deterministic and checksummed, so moving a fighter
  would be a lie about the rules. A spring recoil in `SpriteFighterView`,
  applied to the root so the afterimage trails it rather than sitting in the
  pre-hit spot, settling to exactly zero.

  **A finding about a feeling is usually a finding about a mechanism.** Neither
  model could see the sim; both could see that nobody moved.
- `ippon-impact-underdelivers` (glm) vs `impact-text-obstruction: scale down the
  IPPON text` (qwen3.6-35b) — two models giving opposite instructions on the
  same element. That is what an element at roughly the right size looks like.
- `technique-callout-ownership: "LUNGE PUNCH appears while nobody lunges"`
  (glm) — the round-19 stale-chip finding arriving from a model that has not
  seen the fix.
- `loading-screen-branding` (qwen3.5-27b) — the boot card carries name, matchup,
  logo and publisher line.
- `fight-button-countdown-contrast` (qwen3.6-35b) — 20px in round 12.
- `reclaim-stage-from-controls`, `joystick-oversize`,
  `portrait-composition-waste`, `control-occlusion-hud` — framing, in its
  fourteenth iteration. Standing: warm and low. The pad measures 27.0% of an
  844px screen, which is thumb reach, and 40% was never true.

### Round 24 — kimi-k2.7-code, gpt-5.6-sol, minimax-m3, mistral-medium-3-5 — `217a165`

- `modals-leak-controls: "moves and Settings panels leave the dual sticks
  visible underneath, eating scroll space"` (minimax-m3) — **accepted, and both
  halves were true.** The sheet was `inset: 0` inside #stage, and #stage ends
  228px above the bottom of the phone, so the Techniques list ran out of room
  with a move row sliced in half, no scroll affordance, and the dimmed pad
  eating a third of the screen. Eleven of eighteen moves visible.

  `position: fixed` under `body:has(.sheet:not([hidden]))` lifts it out of the
  stage's flow; the pad is now hidden behind a sheet rather than dimmed.
  Eighteen visible, and the next section header lands at the fold.

  The result card deliberately keeps the dimmed treatment: a sheet is a
  document, a result card is a card over a live bout, and the arena should stay
  faintly visible behind it.
- `unexplained-action-button-badges` (kimi-k2.7-code) and
  `qualifier-intro-typography: ... an unexplained 'FIGHT N' badge` (minimax-m3)
  — **accepted, next round.** Two models independently called the countdown
  numeral on the FIGHT button unexplained. It is a countdown, but nothing in
  the control says so.
- `ippon-face-stickers` (minimax-m3), `tame-impact-whiteout` (gpt-5.6-sol) —
  the defender's white flash reads as a sticker over the face rather than an
  impact. Round 23 gave the struck fighter recoil; the flash peak is the
  remaining half.
- `mistralai/mistral-medium-3-5` — rejected the set at 15 images: "Total number
  of images exceeds the maximum allowed of 8". Same cap round 9 hit on
  mistral-medium-3.1; the review set has outgrown Mistral twice now and the
  retry passes `--max-images 8`.
- `sharpen-loading-brand` (gpt-5.6-sol), `loading-screen-void` (minimax-m3) —
  the MEASURING state, in its tenth appearance across seven providers.
- `ground-fighter-sprites: add contact shadows` (gpt-5.6-sol) — round 3 added
  them and they are visible under both fighters in every bout frame.
- `controls-obscure-fighters`, `control-panel-dominates-screen`,
  `virtual-stick-knobs-too-small`, `portrait-camera-wastes-frame`,
  `tighten-portrait-fight-framing`, `repair-landscape-layout` — framing, in its
  fifteenth iteration. Standing: warm and low.

### Round 25 — mistral-medium-3-5 — `fb40131`

- `settings-toggle-clarity: "settings toggles lack visual state feedback"` —
  **rejected, and the rejection is the finding.** The toggles have had a legible
  state in both directions since round 21, when they were rebuilt as switches
  with a knob that holds a position either way.

  They are also all-off in every settings frame this harness has ever produced,
  because the harness never clicked one. A reviewer looking at six identical
  dark tracks was reasoning correctly from a one-sided sample and reached a
  false conclusion — the same failure as the returning-player pad in round 18,
  and the same one five models produced in round 15 before I finally made the
  mixed-state capture that existed only in a verification screenshot and never
  in the review set.

  `15-phone-settings-mixed` fixes it: two on, four off.

  **A fix that is only ever verified in a screenshot you looked at alone is not
  in the loop. It has to be in the set the next reviewer sees.** Round 15 made
  this exact capture and then did not ship it, and four models paid for it.
- `hud-score-legibility: "score text is hard to read mid-fight"` — the scoreline
  plate is opaque and the scores are `--text` and `--fighter-1`, the two
  brightest values in the palette, on top of it. Rounds 5 and 10 took both as
  far as the art direction allows.
- `rematch-button-visibility: "rematch button blends into the background"` — it
  is a gold plate with a bright ring and a glow, on a stage the round-20 veil
  deliberately darkened. It is the loudest control in the result card.
- `loading-logo-contrast` — the ShoeMoney mark is proprietary and may not be
  recoloured, filtered or restyled. A plate behind it is the only available
  lever and is not yet warranted; the boot card measured at 8.4:1.
- `fighter-vertical-placement` — framing, in its sixteenth iteration. Standing:
  warm and low.

### Round 26 — perceptron-mk1.5, grok-4.5, gpt-5.5, qwen3.8-max-0902 — `5f775bc`

- **The hit flash was deleting the fighter it was supposed to sell.** Five
  models across three rounds, none able to name it:
  perceptron-mk1.5 "a bright white glow completely obscures the fighter in
  white"; gpt-5.6-sol "preserve fighter readability during scoring hits";
  gpt-5.5 "reduce hit flash clipping"; qwen3.8-max-0902 "the receiver clips to
  a featureless white blob on IPPON"; minimax-m3 "reads as face paint, not
  impact".

  The captured impact frame shows exactly what they saw — face, gi, arms and
  chest emblem all clipped to one flat white silhouette, for 140ms, at the
  moment the player is trying to see that the hit landed.

  One line of arithmetic: `flash()` was `color.setScalar(1 + amount * 2.4)` and
  a full point passes `amount: 1`. A 3.4x multiplier on an already-lit texture.
  No mask, no post-pass, no bloom to blame — the sprite was told to render at
  three and a half times its own light. Now 1.75, and 95ms instead of 140ms.
  Re-captured: bright, obviously struck, completely readable.

  Round 23 fixed the half of this that was motion and left the half that was
  light, and it took two more rounds before the light was reported loudly
  enough to act on. **Five reviewers agreeing is not the signal. Five reviewers
  pointing at the same frame is.**
- `kick-sprite-crop-artifacts: "floating limb fragment and a kick foot that
  vanishes into the torso"` (qwen3.8-max-0902) — **rejected against the burst.**
  The four-frame back-kick sequence shows a clean wind-up, a fully extended kick
  with the foot attached to the leg and the standing leg planted, and a return
  to guard. The foot is *near* the torso in frame 1 because that is the tucked
  wind-up, and at a glance a tucked foot reads as a swallowed one.
- `technique-callout-attribution: "anchor technique callouts to the acting
  fighter and mark who performed them"` (qwen3.8-max-0902) — the chip is only
  ever written for `event.player === 0`, so it is always the player's own move.
  There is nothing to attribute.
- `pre-fight-countdown-occlusion` (grok-4.5), `crop-empty-wall-enlarge-fighters`
  (gpt-5.5), `portrait-camera-dead-headroom` (qwen3.8-max-0902),
  `fighter-scale-framing` (grok-4.5) — framing, in its seventeenth iteration.
  Standing: warm and low.
- `handle-landscape-or-lock-portrait` (gpt-5.5) — landscape is a real, supported
  second target; the ADR makes portrait the baseline and desktop the scaled
  secondary, not the only one.
- `make-loading-progress-readable`, `loading-bar-no-progress` — the MEASURING
  state, in its eleventh appearance across eight providers. The single most
  reported non-defect in the loop; it is the honest state of a bundle still
  downloading, and every model that has ever called it a bug has been wrong.

### Round 27 — gpt-5.4, deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp, qwen3.6-plus, reka-edge — `6d45283`

- `countdown-button-affordance` / `unexplained-action-button-badges` /
  `countdown-button-ambiguity` (deepseek-v4-flash, kimi-k2.7-code r24,
  minimax-m3 r24, qwen3.6-plus) — **accepted after two failed answers.** The
  button read "FIGHT ③". A bare numeral in a circle on a gold pill beside a
  score reads as a point total, because that is what a numeral in a circle
  beside a score means everywhere else in this HUD.

  The first fix gave the number its own badge and marked the two apart for
  screen readers — that fixed the accessibility and not the picture, which is
  why the finding came back twice. It now says what it is: "FIGHT IN 2", a
  small rectangular label in the sans face, circle removed. The aria-label was
  always correct and nobody reads it while looking at the picture.
- `browser-focus-ring: "ugly browser focus outline on Settings toggle"`
  (qwen3.6-plus) — **accepted.** The native outline drew a second, squarer box
  around a control that is already a pill, on every keyboard pass through the
  sheet. Own `:focus-visible` ring; the default is suppressed.
- `rekaai/reka-edge` — **cannot take this set.** 16,384-token context ceiling
  against 35,603 requested, 23,120 of it image. Not a prompt defect.
- `score-fraction-readability: "2 1/2" is hard to parse` (qwen3.6-plus) —
  `points()` emits `2½`; the glyph and its lack of a space are the complaint,
  and the moves sheet spells the rule out in full beside it.
- `stick-arrow-contrast` (deepseek-v4-flash) — `--detent-idle` went 0.36 → 0.52
  in round 21, a shade over 5:1 against the ring.
- `top-right-touch-targets: "MOVES and settings buttons are too small"`
  (deepseek-v4-flash) — 60px plaques with a 56px minimum hit area, raised to
  the bezel edge in round 3.
- `fighters-too-small-on-phone`, `controls-dominating-lower-half`,
  `top-hud-crowded-and-uneven`, `fight-scene-composition`,
  `landscape-camera-zoom` — framing, in its eighteenth iteration. Standing:
  warm and low.

### Round 28 — claude-opus-5.5, gpt-5.4-pro, seed-2.0-lite, qwen3.5-122b-a10b

- **`floating-fist-sprite-artifact` / `floating-hand-animation-bug` /
  `floating limb fragment` / `severed foot` — CONFIRMED, five models, and the
  round-22 refutation was scoped to the wrong move.** Enumerated the full input
  grammar to find the move none of the bursts had reached — Front Kick is
  `neutral+up` — and burst-captured it. A **detached foot, complete with toes,
  floats in mid-air at the left of the figure** through the extension frames.

  Round 22 refuted this on the *back* kick, correctly, and I let a correct
  refutation of one move dismiss a finding about a different one. The models
  kept saying fist, hand, foot and limb because the fragment is small and
  skin-coloured; nobody could name it because it is not a limb, it is a limb
  that is not attached to anything.

  **Open.** The artifact is in the shipped atlas (`apps/game/public/fighters/
  shiro-1.webp`, `front_kick` frames 61–66), so the fix is in
  `build-fighter-atlas.py` against a regenerated contact sheet, and the source
  sheets are gitignored. Not attempted blind: a half-verified edit to a keyed
  alpha atlas is how you get a worse bug than the one you were fixing.
- `control-legend-contradicts-moves` (claude-opus-5.5) — **accepted.** The coach
  legend taught the technique stick as ◀ reverse / ▶ forward / ▲ high / ▼ down
  while the Moves sheet groups the same four directions under RIGHT STICK
  FORWARD / BACK / UP / DOWN. Two vocabularies for one control. The coach now
  follows the sheet, because the sheet is what a player opens to look a move up.
- `hide-dead-controls-on-overlays` (gpt-5.4-pro) — the pre-fight card is
  excluded from the modal dimming on purpose, and the comment says why: it is a
  countdown that ends in the fight, not a dialog, and dimming its pad meant the
  controls were at 18% seconds before the player had to use them.
- `loading-bar-*` (gpt-5.4-pro, seed-2.0-lite, qwen3.5-122b) — the MEASURING
  state, in its twelfth appearance across nine providers.
- `unskippable-rematch-countdown` (seed-2.0-lite) — the whole button is the skip
  affordance, which is what "FIGHT IN 2" now says on the first line of it.
- `half-point-score-hard-to-parse` / `fraction-score-ambiguity` (gpt-5.4-pro,
  seed-2.0-lite) — third and fourth report of the same thing across two rounds.
  Real, and the fix is glyph choice, not layout: see next round.
- `fighters-too-small-on-phone`, `fighter-vertical-cramping`,
  `portrait-combat-framing-too-wide`, `control-legend-too-small` — framing, in
  its nineteenth iteration. Standing: warm and low.

### Round 29 — the detached fragments, `a47ad7b`

Round 28's open item is closed, and it is the largest single defect the loop has
found.

Connected-component analysis over both fighters' atlases — six pages, 44 cells
each — found **14 detached fragments**. They are not confined to one frame: the
back hand is drawn as its own island because the keyer separated it from the
sleeve, and in several frames the figure already has both fists up in guard, so
the island is a duplicate of a hand that is already there.

`tools/despeckle-fighters.py` erases them. One rule: within each cell keep the
largest connected component of opaque pixels, drop the rest. Bodies run
14000–26000px, the largest fragment is 550px — a factor of 25, no per-frame
tuning. `--check` reports and exits non-zero.

**The lesson, which is the whole loop in one line:** a reviewer describing an
artefact reliably points at a frame where something is wrong, and cannot name
it. Five reviewers naming five different body parts is one artefact seen five
times, and every name was wrong, because it is not a body part — it is a body
part attached to nothing.

And the process failure that let it live nine rounds: in round 22 I bursted the
*back* kick, found it clean, and refuted a finding that was about a *different
move*. A correct refutation scoped to the wrong thing is worse than no
refutation, because it looks like diligence.

### Round 30 — grok-4.3, gpt-5.3-codex, qwen3.5-plus-02-15 — `3149f0a`

- `settings-toggle-contrast: "poor off-state visibility"` (grok-4.3) — lifted
  the off track again, #2a2019 → #352a20. Round 21 moved it off pure black and
  round 25 put the state system into the review set, but the value was still a
  guess rather than a measured one.
- `low-contrast-stick-affordance: "default virtual sticks are too dim to read
  at a glance"` (gpt-5.3-codex), following deepseek-v4-flash r27,
  qwen3.8-flash r21 and glm-5.3-flashx r20 — **four reports over four rounds.**
  `--detent-idle` 0.36 → 0.52 helped and did not close it; 0.68 now. Verified
  at 1:1 on a re-captured stick.
- `technique-popup-size` (grok-4.3) and `micro-text-under-pressure`
  (gpt-5.3-codex) — the move callout, one step under body size and a full step
  down in colour. Now body size on `--text-muted`.
- `stick-input-feedback-mismatch: "stick visualizer shows raw touch position,
  not snapped input"` (qwen3.5-plus-02-15) — worth a look, not yet checked.
- `loading-progress-bar`, `loading-progress-visibility` — the MEASURING state,
  in its thirteenth appearance across ten providers.
- `controls-visible-during-countdown` (grok-4.3) — the pre-fight card is
  deliberately excluded from modal dimming; documented in the stylesheet.
- `fighters-look-pasted-over-the-mat` (gpt-5.3-codex),
  `sprites-not-graded-into-scene` (claude-opus-5.5) — two models, independently,
  saying the fighters are not graded into the warm tungsten scene. Real art
  direction note, and the opposite of the standing "make it brighter" rejection:
  this asks for the sprites to match the room, not the room to match them.
- `mistralai/mistral-small-2603` — 429, upstream shared pool rate-limited. Not a
  model defect; retry later.

**Process note.** The callout edit was a `str.replace(pattern, 1)` over a
file-wide pattern. It reported success, changed a different rule 400 lines
earlier, and left `.technique` untouched. All three edits are now whole-rule
matches with an `assert count == 1`, so a miss is loud.

### Round 31 — glm-5v-turbo, qwen3-vl-30b-a3b, ernie-4.5-vl-424b-a47b — `9d1e4b6`

- **A sampling bug I introduced one round ago, caught by the models disagreeing
  with the thing they were shown.** qwen3-vl-30b and ernie-4.5-vl both reported
  "the settings menu lacks sufficient contrast". Round 25's mixed-state capture
  toggled rows 1 and 3 — High contrast and Left-handed — so every reviewer saw
  the sheet in its *best-case theme* and could not judge the default one at all.

  **Toggling a state must not change the conditions under which the state is
  being reviewed.** It now toggles Mute sound and Show performance HUD, which
  have no effect on how the sheet paints. Re-captured: the default theme with a
  genuine mix, and the labels read white on near-black. The finding was a true
  observation of a frame that was not the product's default.

  This is the loop's recurring lesson arriving from a new direction. Rounds 17,
  18 and 25 were all "the sample never varied a dimension". This one is "the
  sample varied a dimension *too much*, and in doing so hid the thing".
- `vignette-overkill: "excessive vignette darkens the center of the screen"`
  (qwen3-vl-30b) — **rejected on measurement.** Centre 10% mean luminance 81.7,
  centre 20% 89.1, centre 35% 77.8, outer ring 31.6, corners 16.5. The centre
  is the brightest region on screen and the corners are the darkest, which is
  precisely what a vignette is for. The claim describes the inverse of the
  effect.
- `settings-contrast` / `settings-menu-contrast` — see above. Default theme
  re-captured and legible.
- `fight-result-screen-delay` (ernie) — the 8s auto-start, skipped by tapping
  the button, which is the whole button.
- `prefight-text-obstruction: "opaque pre-fight text box hides character models"`
  (glm-5v-turbo) — the pre-fight card is deliberately translucent over a live
  arena, and it is a countdown that ends in the fight, not a dialog.
- `hud-clutter` (ernie), `move-list-clutter` / `moves-list-cognitive-load`
  (qwen3-vl-30b, qwen3.5-plus r30), `controls-overlap` /
  `control-overlap: "control stick overlap"` (qwen3-vl-30b, ernie),
  `portrait-vertical-waste`, `control-legend-clutter` — framing and density, in
  its twentieth iteration. Standing: warm and low, and the pad is 27.0% of an
  844px screen.
